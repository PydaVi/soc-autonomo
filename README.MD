# SOC Aut√¥nomo

> üáßüá∑ [Leia esta p√°gina em portugu√™s](./README.pt-br.md)

Network packet analysis focused on cybersecurity using tools like Suricata, Zeek, and the Elastic stack.

> An open source, lightweight, modular, and portable approach to investigating PCAP files from an information security perspective.

## üéØ Purpose

This project was born as part of my hands-on cybersecurity learning journey, especially during my studies for the **CompTIA Security+** certification. While trying to understand real-world attacks through forensic analysis, I found it difficult to access free labs or tools that would run on modest machines.

Using open source tools and a container-based architecture, I created this environment to meet that personal need. By making it public, my goal is to help **democratize access to cybersecurity tools**, offering a local, lightweight solution with no external dependencies, but with high analytical capabilities.

## üîç What does the project do?

* Analyzes `.pcap` files with **Zeek** and **Suricata**, generating network event logs.
* Integrates logs into the **Elastic stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Filebeat)** for centralized visualization and investigation.
* Includes pre-configured dashboards to support quick forensic analysis and incident response.

---

## üß± Modular Architecture

The project is built on independent, reusable modules. This provides:

* Easy integration of new functionalities and tools
* Runs with `Docker` and `docker-compose`, making resource usage efficient
* Helper scripts written in `bash` for automation

## üì¶ How to use

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PydaVi/soc-autonomo.git
cd soc-autonomo
```

2. **Set permissions for filebeat.yml and requisitos.sh**:

```bash
sudo chown root:root filebeat.yml
sudo chmod +x requisitos.sh
```

3. **Install dependencies (if needed)**:

```bash
sudo ./requisitos.sh
```

4. **Add your `.pcap` files to:**

```
modules/00-pcap-forensics/sample-pcaps/
```

5. **Run the environment**:

```bash
make up
```

6. **Parse logs and load dashboards**:

```bash
make parse
```

7. **Access Kibana** at `http://localhost:5601` to explore the dashboards.

8. **Tear down the containers**:

```bash
make down
```
